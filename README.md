# Hey, I'm Mohamed

**Cybersecurity student | Email Copywriter | Future Red Teamer**

I'm on a mission to master hacking, build sharp skills in ethical cybersecurity, and help brands grow through killer email strategies. 

Even though I’m still a student, I treat my journey like a professional — every day is a step forward, and every line of code or copy gets me closer.

### What I'm Working On:
- Learning ethical hacking (TryHackMe, Hack The Box)
- Studying Linux, networking, and Python
- Crafting cold emails that actually convert
- Building my first open-source project soon (stay tuned)

### Tools I’m Learning:
- Kali Linux / Parrot OS
- Nmap, Burp Suite, Wireshark
- Python, Bash
- Git & GitHub
- Email marketing tools
